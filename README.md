# OIIE Adapter Shell

OIIE Adapter Shell provides the core functionality of an OIIE adapter without any system specific transformations.

# TODO

Need to add the following to this README:
* the purpose of the repository
* explanation of version/release numbering (recommended that [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) be adopted)
* reference to the change log
* any prerequisites/dependencies that must be manually fulfilled (development and/or production)
* special instructions to developers, if any, to work with the content of the repository
* reference to user documentation, if applicable
* deployment instructions, if applicable: generally speaking, we are using Docker for deployment so this may be a boilerplate section pointing to the Dockerfile but may
* still include information on configuration, environment variables, etc., that need to be addressed in deployment
